                    <h3>High School</h3>
                    <p>
                        I graduated from Rubidoux High School in Riverside, California in 2015. I graduated with a GPA above 3.0 and
                        took multiple honors classes. I volunteered heavily with my church and also was on the football team. I passed multiple AP exams and began looking in to computer programming.

                    <p>
                        I graduated from the Renton Technical College in June 2022 with a GPA of 3.5 and an AAS of Computer Science. In my
                        program I learned C#, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS and SQL. I also taught myself the basics of the Unity Engine and can use it basic level.

                    <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently I am in the process of learning C++ and as I get more comfortable with it I would like to branch out into the Unreal Engine. After C++, I would also like to learn Python and React. I am constantly trying to learn and build upon my skillset.

                    <h3>Short Term</h3>
                    <p>
                        Right now I am currently looking for any available job in the industry. I want to enter the industry and begin building experience and improving as a programmer. I have a solid skill set and am confident in my ability to use any language I know to code. I also want to learn from more experienced programmers and be able to better myself.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Long Term</h3>
                    <p>
                        My ultimate career goal is to work in game development. I love games and want to be a part of the game industry. 
                        My skill set is currently not where I would like it to be for this, but it is something I am actively working on.
                        This is why I am trying to learn both the Unity and Unreal engines. I hope to be able to build my own small projects
                        in these engines in the future and someday make my dream of being a game developer a reality.

                        I built this website from scratch as a way to demonstrate my HTML and CSS skills. It also serves as
                        a place where I can promote myself and serves as a psuedo-resume.

                                I built this calculator using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It did not utilize the Math.js library
                                as that was not permitted for the assignment. It has issues with the negative numbers not acting
                                properly as well as some other minor errors. It also is only numpad compatible with the 
                                keyboard and I need to resolve that issue.

                        I am not super happy with this project. The app does not function properly and I ran into many errors during 
                        the build process. I think it is important to highlight my failures and to learn and grow from them. The underlying
                        code for the project has the right idea I was just unable to fully execute my vision for the project.

                        I built this project following a Kaboom.js tutorial. This was to learn and experiment with game development
                        through javascript.

                        This is not a complete project. This was just to get my feet wet with Unity and to learn the basics of the engine.
                        I learned about colliders, camera positioning and movement, and how to apply scripts to objects. I also attempted to
                        connect a database to the project that would store scores but I was unable to get it to work.
