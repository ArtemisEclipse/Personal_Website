                    <p>
                        I graduated from Rubidoux High School in Riverside, California in 2015. I recently began to attend the
                        Renton Technical College in their computer science program. I am looking to graduate with a bachelor's
                        and a GPA of 3.5 or above. I am still new to computer programming and my only experience so far has been
                        through my courses. I am looking to teach myself both the Unity engine and the Python language by the time I graduate.

                        Career Goals
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        My ultimate career goal is to work in game development. I love games and want to be a part of the industry. My short term goal at the moment is to develop my own game in the Unity engine. I want to have the experience of building a game from the ground up and I feel as though it would be a good milestone to reach for me personally. After the game is done, I might go on to make more individual projects if I cannot land a job in the industry outright. I would also like to expand past only being able to use the Unity engine and would explore other options such as the Unreal engine.

                    <p>One of my goals after I learn more about HTML and Javascript is to build my own website from
                        scratch.
                        The website would hold stream clips and highlights. It would also be a location for people to
                        find
                        decks I use for card games, teams I use for pokemon, my current rank in competitive games, and
                        potentially more. It would be an area to centeralize all of the content I create and be a place
                        for
                        viewers to find any stream information they would like.</p>

                        coding and I really enjoy his insight in regards to programming. I would like to work with him
                        on
                        one of his browser games to work on development skills and working on a team. I feel that he
                        could
                        help me grow and it would be an excellent benchmark for me to reach. It also segways into
                        another
                        project I want to work on.</p>

                        build my own game. Games have always been a passion of mine since I was young. I was never good
                        at
                        the arts so the only way I reckoned I could work on games is through programming. This is my
                        ultimate goal with my education and it would be a culmination of all the skills I have developed
                        and
                        a dream come true for me.</p>
