                    <h2>Stream Website</h2>
                    <p>One of my goals after I learn more about HTML and Javascript is to build my own website from
                        scratch.
                        The website would hold stream clips and highlights. It would also be a location for people to
                        find
                        decks I use for card games, teams I use for pokemon, my current rank in competitive games, and
                        potentially more. It would be an area to centeralize all of the content I create and be a place
                        for
                        viewers to find any stream information they would like.</p>

                    <h2>Browser Game</h2>
                    <p>I have a friend that makes browser games in his spare time. He is one of the reasons I got into
                        coding and I really enjoy his insight in regards to programming. I would like to work with him
                        on
                        one of his browser games to work on development skills and working on a team. I feel that he
                        could
                        help me grow and it would be an excellent benchmark for me to reach. It also segways into
                        another
                        project I want to work on.</p>

                    <h2>My Own Game</h2>
                    <p>After I build more experience and get some time spent on developing browser games I would like to
                        build my own game. Games have always been a passion of mine since I was young. I was never good
                        at
                        the arts so the only way I reckoned I could work on games is through programming. This is my
                        ultimate goal with my education and it would be a culmination of all the skills I have developed
                        and
                        a dream come true for me.</p>
